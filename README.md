+#+ Youness- About-Me : Computer Engineering (Cybersecurity)

Final-semester Computer Engineering student specializing in cybersecurity.  
I focus on **blue-team security**, detection engineering, network monitoring, and secure backend systems.

I build projects that simulate **real security workflows**: collecting data, detecting threats, reducing false positives and explaining security decisions clearly.

+#+ Career Goals after Graduation:

Seeking : Junior Cybersecurity / SOC / Security Engineering roles where I can grow in detection, monitoring, and defensive security.


+#+ Security Focus

- Detection Engineering: log analysis, rule-based and anomaly detection
- 
- Blue Team / SOC: alerts, investigations and incident logic
- 
- Networking: traffic inspection, protocol analysis and PCAPs
- 
- Secure Development: authentication, access control and audit logging



+#+ Featured Projects

 Projects below are intended to mirror actual real world security tasks

+#+ Mini-SIEM Lab *(in progress)*
Log ingestion and normalization → detection rules → alerts

- Parses security and system log
  
- Applies Sigma-style detection logic
- 
- Outputs alerts with investigation context

+#+ Lightweight Network IDS *(in progress/ My engineering Diploma Degree thesis)*

Network traffic analysis and threat detection  

- Feature extraction from traffic
  
- Baseline vs anomaly detection
  
- Evaluation of detection accuracy

+#+ Secure REST API *(in progress)*

Security-first backend design

 JWT authentication + RBAC
 
 Rate limiting and audit logging
 
 Threat modeling (OWASP / STRIDE)



+#+ Tech Stack

Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, C# 

Security: Networking, IDS/IPS concepts, log analysis

**Tools:** Linux, Git, Docker, Packet Tracer

**Concepts:** Authentication, access control, threat modeling
